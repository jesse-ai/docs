# Supported Exchanges

Not every exchange provides historical candles that can be used for doing backtesting and research. But they all offer candles for live trading.

Hence, supported exchanges for backtesting and live trading are different.

## Backtesting

So far, the below exchanges are supported for **importing candles and running backtests**:

-   `Binance Spot`
-   `Binance US Spot`
-   `Binance Perpetual Futures`
-   `Bitfinex Spot`
-   `Coinbase Spot`
-   `Bybit USDT Perpetual`
-   `Bybit USDC Perpetual`
-   `Bybit Spot`

::: tip
Notice that the words `Spot` and `Futures` in the exchange names above merely indicate the source of the candles and NOT the type of backtests you can run with them.

For example you can use candles from `Binance Spot` to run backtests in both **spot** and **futures** mode and vice versa.

You can change the type of exchange for backtests in the settings page per each individual exchange.
