## Working with Jesse
### The bot does not start. What's wrong?
Check if you followed the instructions on [Installation](/docs/installation) right and did the [Configuration](/docs/configuration) part. For backtesting to work you also need to set [Routes](/docs/routes).
###  How do I configure Jesse?
Check the [Configuration](/docs/configuration) page.

<!---### I have waited 10 minutes, why hasn't the bot made any trades yet?!
Thats entirly depending on your strategy and chosen timeframe. One reason could be, that the conditions on which your strategy would place a buy or sell order aren't met. Another reason could be that the current candle in your chosen timeframe didn't close yet. Jesse only trades after the candle has closed.
### I have made 20 trades already, why is my total profit negative?!
There could be multiple reasons:
 - Your strategy isn't profitable. Be sure to always backtest your strategy.
 - You did a backtest, but it's still not making profits. Your strategy could be only working in certain market conditions (for example trending - not trending). Be sure to make extensive backtests, especially in different periods of time with different market conditions (bullish, bearish, flat, big market crashes). 
 - You did extensive backtests and it's still not profitable in the current market conditions? That can happen too. Backtesting only checks historical data. The market could change in such a way, that "old rules" won't work anymore. Time to be creative.
 - Good backtest results on one coin pair don't mean the results will be good on other pairs too. Time for more backtesting!-->

### My strategy isn't working/trading like it should. What can I do?
Are you certain you set the right [Routes](/docs/routes) and have the right version of your strategy uploaded? It's important to be structured here: Be sure to use clear naming and versioning of your strategies. Speaking of experience. It's annoying but saves you time. If you are sure Jesse is really running the strategy (version) you intended, let's check more things you can do.
 - Use the `--debug` command in backtesting to have Jesse print the trades that are happening or aren't. 
 - Check the conditions for validity. To do that a good way is adding pythons `print()` command in your strategies functions. For example `print("Buy condition checked")`. That way you can validate if all the functions are called like intended and aren't mixed up. If you found the mistake like that: Good job! 
```python
from datetime import datetime
time = datetime.fromtimestamp(self.current_candle[0] / 1000)
print('Time: {} | My Buy conditions: {} {}'.format(time, self.condition1, self.condition2))
```
 - If not use the code above for more debugging. The braces are replaced with the variables you pass in the format function. Keep the first time variable. It will give you the time of the current candle. Change the other variable according to your strategy. That way you are able to check precisely the values of your functions and indicators candlewise. Then open your favorite charting tool (same timeframe, same indicators) and do a comparison. That way you should be able to spot mistakes in your conditions/calculations.

### Your backtest results differ from backtesting with the XXX tool. What's the reason?
Ask yourself: Is the strategy I tested on XXX really the same strategy in Jesse? Consider stoplosses and commission fees. 
Additionally, many backtest tools have the so-called lookahead/repainting issue.

<!---### I’d like to change the trading amount. Can I just stop the bot and then change the config and run it again?
Not quite. If you stop the bot, you also need to close all currently open orders. Don't forget the stoploss orders.-->
