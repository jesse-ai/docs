# Research

The "**research**" module is a collection of Jesse's features (that you typically use via the GUI dashboard) made available via functions for research purposes. 

You can use these functions in either your custom **Python scripts**, or in your **Jupyter Notebooks** for research purposes.

Assuming you already have installed Jesse try importing the research module:

```py
from jesse import research
```
