# Backtest

Assuming you already have [created](./strategies/generating-new-strategy.md) your first strategy, [imported](./import-candles.md) historical candles, and have set correct [routes](./routes.md) for your strategy, it is time to actually backtest it:

::: warning
Spot support is currently very limited - you can use futures mode with leverage 1 for now.
:::


```
jesse backtest 'start_date' 'finish_date'
```

`start_date` and `finish_date` must be valid date strings in `YY-MM-DD` format. A working example would be:

```
jesse backtest '2016-01-01' '2020-04-06'
```

And here is the output:

```

There are further metrics that are disabled by default. To enable them open your project's `config.py` file and set the values to True:
```py
'metrics': {
    'sharpe_ratio': True,
    'calmar_ratio': False,
    'sortino_ratio': False,
    'omega_ratio': False,
    'winning_streak': False,
    'losing_streak': False,
    'largest_losing_trade': False,
    'largest_winning_trade': False,
    'total_winning_trades': False,
    'total_losing_trades': False,
}
```

## Charts

Performing backtest with the `chart` flag would print out charts for the balance change of your portfolio in the backtest period, and buy/sell points on the asset price change%.

```
jesse backtest '2016-01-01' '2020-04-06' --chart 
```

When the backtest is finished, Jesse prints the path to the output chart image file:

```
Chart output saved at:
storage/charts/BT-2020-04-13T15-44-42.png
```

And here's the image (click to zoom or open image in a new tab to see the full size):

## TradingView

This feature is useful for those who use [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com) for their chart needs.
Add the `--tradingview` flag to the backtest command:

```
jesse backtest '2019-01-01' '2019-10-30' --tradingview
```

At the end of the process, it will print out the path to a .txt file with a pine script as content. Then open the file, copy its content and paste it inside [TradingView's](https://www.tradingview.com) Pine Editor. Now click on "Add to chart" and you will see entries and exits of the strategy.

::: warning
Make sure to see the chart in the same timeframe as the backtest simulation was executed on. Also, only the last ~30 trades are displayed because of a limit on TradingView's side.
:::

## CSV

Jesse can output completed trades into a CSV file. You may open this CSV file with Excel, Google sheets, or whatever tool you like to analyse completed trades, draw further charts, etc.

**Usage:** Add the `--csv` flag to the backtest command:
```
jesse backtest '2019-01-01' '2019-10-30' --csv
```

Once the backtest is completed, Jesse will print the path to the CSV file.

## JSON

Jesse can output completed trades into a file with JSON format. JSON format is a popular javascript format that is usually used to create APIs on the web. 

**Usage:** Add the `--json` flag to the backtest command:
```
jesse backtest '2019-01-01' '2019-10-30' --json
```

Once the backtest is completed, Jesse will print the path to the JSON file.

## Full Report

Generates [QuantStats'](https://github.com/ranaroussi/quantstats) HTML output.

**Usage:** Add the `--full-reports` flag to the backtest command:
```
jesse backtest '2019-01-01' '2019-10-30' --full-reports
```

## Visual analyze of completed trades

There is a very cool tool called "Jesse trades info" made by one of the community members. It helps to parse JSON backtest files and to display them in a convenient way using tables and charts.

You can find screenshots and a video on its [Github repository page](https://github.com/nicolay-zlobin/jesse-trades-info).
