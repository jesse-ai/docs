# Preventing Overfitting

When it  comes to optimization, overfitting is probably the biggest danger. There are many ways to handle it, here is the method that we suggest:

Divide your dataset (of candles) into 3 periods. Training, testing, and validation. Here is a step-by-step example:

Imagine that you want to optimize your strategy for a period of 2 years(24 months). Let's say that two years is from 2018-01-01 to 2020-01-01. First cut a 6 months period of data preferably from the end of that period. We'll later use this dataset for validation. 

Now start the optimize mode for 2018-01-01 to 2019-06-01:
```
# 100 is the optimal_total number of trades
jesse optimize 2018-01-01 2019-06-01 100
```

Behind the scenes, Jesse divides this dataset into two periods; training(85%) and testing(15%). The training period is what Jesse uses to optimize the strategy's parameters. The testing period is merely a period that gets backtested at the same time as the training period. Why? Because if a DNA string is performing well on both training and testing periods, there's a good chance that it will perform well overall. 

In the optimize mode's dashboard, there's a **log** section which displays the win-rate, total (number of trades) and the PNL metrics for the training period as well as the testing period. Here is an example:
