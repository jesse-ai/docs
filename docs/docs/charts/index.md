# Charts

Jesse supports a variety of charts, helping you visualize your trading strategies, both the results of backtests and in real-time.

## Equity Curve

After the backtest simulation is finished, you will get to see the **equity curve** of your daily balances. Here is how it looks:

You can also enable the **benchmark** feature to compare your equity curve to a **buy-and-hold** strategy for the assets you are trading.
