# Live Trade

The "live-trade" plugin is available for early access. You can read the announcement article or head over to our website, [register](https://jesse.trade/register) and get your license, and then head over to the installation page. 

## Supported Exchanges

At the moment only `Binance Futures` and its testnet version are supported for live/paper trading. Next I will implement support for the FTX exchange. And after that, most likely spot exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, etc. New exchange drivers are developed based on demand. 

So if you need an exchange that is not supported, please reach out and let me know. 

## Screenshots?
Here is a sample of the early access version which has a CLI dashboard:

Version 1 of the plugin (coming in a month or so) will have a GUI through a web URL. 


## Installation
The package is pre-built. You need to download the proper version for your OS and Python version from the [releases](https://jesse.trade/releases) page. 

After downloading it, open your terminal, go to the directory that the downloaded package is located at, and install it using `pip`:

```
# replace the {name of the downloaded file} with your downloaded package
pip install {name of the downloaded file}
```

Now you should be able to run live trade commands from within your Jesse project. But first, you need to log in. This of course assumes you already have a valid license on the website. Run:
```
jesse login
```

This command asks you for your email and password that you used for registering at https://jesse.trade. Once you pass that, it'll create the `live-config.py` file which is specifically for your live trades and is located just within your Jesse project. Open it, and enter your values for notifications, exchange keys, etc. 

Now you can successfully run live sessions by running `jesse live`. You can also run trades with paper money by running `jesse paper`. 

## Terminating the session

To terminate the session, if you are on Linux or macOS, press `CTRL` + `c` and it'll terminate it in a few seconds. On Windows, unfortunately, that doesn't work. With some keyboards, you can press the `break` key and it'll do the same. If you don't, just close the CMD app. It's not clean, but it'll do. Remember that you're not supposed to run production sessions from your local. It is highly recommended to use a VPS to run your sessions. 

## Debug mode

If you need more detailed logs, run them with the `--debug` flag:
```
jesse live --debug
```

## The terminal app
The app that you use to run the live session from matters. For example, PyCharm's built-in terminal is not interactive and live trade doesn't work in it.

If you're on macOS or Linux, the built-in terminal apps are fine. On Windows, we tested the built-in CMD and it works fine.
