# What is Jesse?

Jesse is an advanced algo-trading framework that helps you to write trading strategies in Python, backtest them with the most accurate backtesting engine on the Internet, optimize them using AI, and trade them on live markets. **It focuses on simplicity, accuracy, and flexibility**. 

## Why do I need it?

The short answer is: Jesse is more accurate, and way simpler than other solutions out there. In fact, if I have to summarize Jesse in one word, that word would be **simplicity**. Don't just take my word for it; try writing a strategy in Jesse and any other bot out there to see the difference by yourself.

## Features

Here are few (but not all) features of Jesse that you might be interested in:

-   The **simplest** possible syntax for **defining your strategies**. Supports both simple and advanced strategies. 
-   The **most complete** library of **technical indicators** with the simplest usage syntax, documentation, and examples.
-   **Smart ordering system**: Supports three major order types (market, limit, and stop) while no need to think about which order type to use. It'll take care of it for you.
-   **Multiple timeframes**: Jesse supports the usage of multiple timeframes without the **look-ahead bias**! 
-   **Multiple symbols**: You have access to multiple symbols even inside the same strategy. Want to trade `ETH` but still have a look at `BTC`? You got it!

-   **Risk-management** helper functions.
-   A complete **metrics** system to get useful info about your strategy.
